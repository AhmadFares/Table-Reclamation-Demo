Suppose we are playing a game in which at each step we can advance one entry or two entries of the array. This leads us to a way of representing $n$ as a sum of natural numbers.

As an example, consider $n=5$ and the steps $1,\, 2,\, 2$. Then we get

$5 = (1 $ $\color{red} |$ $ 1 + 1 $ $\color{red} | $ $ 1 + 1)$, this is, $5 = 1 + 2 + 2$.
